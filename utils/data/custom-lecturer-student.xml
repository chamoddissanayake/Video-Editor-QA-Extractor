		<Post class="Lecturer">Great. Let's start the lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">First we should understand what is object-oriented programming?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">In Object-oriented programming, as the name suggests uses objects in programming.

		<Post class="Lecturer">Good morning students.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">How was the last week lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have any questions?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The Android SDK is a collection of software development tools and libraries required to develop Android applications.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Lets start today lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Can you all see my screen?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Today topic is Mobile application development</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are two dominant platforms in the modern smartphone market. One is the iOS platform from Apple Incorporation.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The iOS platform is the operating system that powers Apple's popular line of iPhone smartphones.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The second is Android from Google. The Android operating system is used not only by Google devices but also by many other OEMs to built their own smartphones and other smart devices.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are four major development approaches when building mobile applications</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Native Mobile Applications , Cross-Platform Native Mobile Applications, Hybrid Mobile Applications and Progressive Web Applications.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">We have to understand each approach.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Native Mobile Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Does any one has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Cross-Platform Native Mobile Applications?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Cross-platform and hybrid applications allow you to reach a wider audience than native programs since they're targeted at several platforms at once.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several cross platform frameworks such as Xamarin, Flutter, Ionic and so on.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Hybrid Mobile Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hybrid mobile apps are applications that are installed on a device, just like any other app and those are deployed in a native container that uses a mobile WebView object and when the app is used, this object displays web content thanks to the use of web technologies.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Progressive Web Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Progressive Web Apps are web apps that use emerging web browser APIs and features along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Yes I will give you the assignment in next week.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Android studio is the best tool used to develop android applications.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">A UX designer is concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">That all for today's lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have anything to ask?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">No, you do not have lectures.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Thank you very much</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Good Evening students</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Can you see my screen?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have any questions to on previous lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Is everyone joined the lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Ok. Then start the lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Today's lecture is about flutter, one of the popular mobile app development frameworks.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is flutter?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter is a UI toolkit for creating fast, beautiful, natively compiled mobile applications with one programming language and a single codebase and it is developed by Google.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The Flutter SDK has the packages and command-line tools that you need to develop Flutter apps across platforms.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter is based on the dart programming language.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter is free and open-source.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What are stateful widgets in flutter?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several build-in widgets such as Appbar, Columb, container, Elevated button, icon, image, and so many other widgets.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Dart language has several features such as highly optimized for UI, productivity improvements with make changes interactively, Smooth animation and transitions, Just in time compile, and exceptionally fast development cycles.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">We can use any IDE for flutter development such as android studio, Xcode, Intelli J, visual studio, and so on.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter also supports hot reload.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hot restart is much different than hot reload and in Hot restart it destroys the preserves State value and sets them to their default. So if you are using States value in your application then after every hot restart the developer gets a fully compiled application and all the states will be set to their defaults.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter has several build modes such as debug, profile, and release.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What are the gesture events in flutter?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">That's all for today's lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have any questions?</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Today topic is Mobile application development</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are two dominant platforms in the modern smartphone market. One is the iOS platform from Apple Incorporation.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The iOS platform is the operating system that powers Apple's popular line of iPhone smartphones.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The second is Android from Google. The Android operating system is used not only by Google devices but also by many other OEMs to built their own smartphones and other smart devices.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are four major development approaches when building mobile applications</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Native Mobile Applications , Cross-Platform Native Mobile Applications, Hybrid Mobile Applications and Progressive Web Applications.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">We have to understand each approach.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Native Mobile Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Does any one has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Cross-Platform Native Mobile Applications?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Cross-platform and hybrid applications allow you to reach a wider audience than native programs since they're targeted at several platforms at once.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several cross platform frameworks such as Xamarin, Flutter, Ionic and so on.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Hybrid Mobile Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hybrid mobile apps are applications that are installed on a device, just like any other app and those are deployed in a native container that uses a mobile WebView object and when the app is used, this object displays web content thanks to the use of web technologies.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Progressive Web Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Progressive Web Apps are web apps that use emerging web browser APIs and features along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Good afternoon students.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Have you all joined the lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great. Today's lecture is about Object-oriented programming concepts.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have any questions about last week's lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great. Let's start the lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">First we should understand what is object-oriented programming?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">In Object-oriented programming, as the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,in programming. The main aim of Object-oriented programming is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Did you understand it clearly?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Yes. There are 4 main object-oriented concepts. They are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is encapsulation?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Is it clear to you?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Ok. Then go to the next concept which is an abstraction.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is abstraction?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Good.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Then go to the next concept which is inheritance. It is actually a mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Then the last one is polymorphism.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is polymorphism?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great. That's all for today's lecture.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several cloud service providers available such as Amazon web services, Google cloud computing Microsoft Azure.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What are the benefits of cloud computing?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Cloud computing has many advantages such as Cost Savings, Security, Flexibility, Mobility, Insight, Increased Collaboration, Quality Control, Disaster Recovery, Loss Prevention, Automatic Software Updates, Competitive Edge, Sustainability and so many advantages.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">In today's lecture we should understand AWS.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Amazon web services?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">AWS Amazon Web Services is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service IaaS, platform as a service PaaS and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Then we need to understand Software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is a Platform as a service?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Software as a service?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer"> What is infrastructure as a service?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">AWS Currently offers more than 200 services.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">They offer services related to Analytics, Compute, Containers, Databases, Storage, Web hosting, and so on.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">EC2, LightSail, AWS LAmda are some of their computing services.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Does any one has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Cross-Platform Native Mobile Applications?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Cross-platform and hybrid applications allow you to reach a wider audience than native programs since they're targeted at several platforms at once.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several cross platform frameworks such as Xamarin, Flutter, Ionic and so on.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Hybrid Mobile Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hybrid mobile apps are applications that are installed on a device, just like any other app and those are deployed in a native container that uses a mobile WebView object and when the app is used, this object displays web content thanks to the use of web technologies.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter is a UI toolkit for creating fast, beautiful, natively compiled mobile applications with one programming language and a single codebase and it is developed by Google.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The Flutter SDK has the packages and command-line tools that you need to develop Flutter apps across platforms.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Great</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several build-in widgets such as Appbar, Columb, container, Elevated button, icon, image, and so many other widgets.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Dart language has several features such as highly optimized for UI, productivity improvements with make changes interactively, Smooth animation and transitions, Just in time compile, and exceptionally fast development cycles.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">We can use any IDE for flutter development such as android studio, Xcode, Intelli J, visual studio, and so on.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter also supports hot reload.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hot restart is much different than hot reload and in Hot restart it destroys the preserves State value and sets them to their default. So if you are using States value in your application then after every hot restart the developer gets a fully compiled application and all the states will be set to their defaults.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Have you all joined the lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great. Today's lecture is about Object-oriented programming concepts.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have any questions about last week's lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great. Let's start the lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">First we should understand what is object-oriented programming?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">In Object-oriented programming, as the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,in programming. The main aim of Object-oriented programming is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Did you understand it clearly?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Yes. There are 4 main object-oriented concepts. They are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is encapsulation?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Is it clear to you?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Ok. Then go to the next concept which is an abstraction.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is abstraction?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Good.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Then go to the next concept which is inheritance. It is actually a mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Then the last one is polymorphism.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is polymorphism?</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several cloud service providers available such as Amazon web services, Google cloud computing Microsoft Azure.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What are the benefits of cloud computing?</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">In today's lecture we should understand AWS.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Amazon web services?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">AWS Amazon Web Services is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service IaaS, platform as a service PaaS and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Great. Let's start the lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">First we should understand what is object-oriented programming?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">In Object-oriented programming, as the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,in programming. The main aim of Object-oriented programming is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Did you understand it clearly?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Yes. There are 4 main object-oriented concepts. They are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is encapsulation?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Is it clear to you?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Ok. Then go to the next concept which is an abstraction.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is abstraction?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Good.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Then go to the next concept which is inheritance. It is actually a mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Then the last one is polymorphism.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is polymorphism?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great. That's all for today's lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have anything to ask?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Ok I will extend it.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">OK shall we wind up the session?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Thank you</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Did all of you submit the assignment?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">OK let's start today lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Today's lecture is AWS. Amazon web services.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">First of all we should understand cloud computing.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is cloud computing?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several cloud service providers available such as Amazon web services, Google cloud computing Microsoft Azure.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Can you all see my screen?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Today topic is Mobile application development</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are two dominant platforms in the modern smartphone market. One is the iOS platform from Apple Incorporation.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The iOS platform is the operating system that powers Apple's popular line of iPhone smartphones.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The second is Android from Google. The Android operating system is used not only by Google devices but also by many other OEMs to built their own smartphones and other smart devices.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are four major development approaches when building mobile applications</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Native Mobile Applications , Cross-Platform Native Mobile Applications, Hybrid Mobile Applications and Progressive Web Applications.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">We have to understand each approach.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Native Mobile Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Does any one has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Cross-Platform Native Mobile Applications?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Cross-platform and hybrid applications allow you to reach a wider audience than native programs since they're targeted at several platforms at once.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several cross platform frameworks such as Xamarin, Flutter, Ionic and so on.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Hybrid Mobile Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hybrid mobile apps are applications that are installed on a device, just like any other app and those are deployed in a native container that uses a mobile WebView object and when the app is used, this object displays web content thanks to the use of web technologies.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is Progressive Web Application?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Progressive Web Apps are web apps that use emerging web browser APIs and features along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications.</Post>

		<Post class="Lecturer">Good Evening students</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Can you see my screen?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have any questions to on previous lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Is everyone joined the lecture?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Ok. Then start the lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Today's lecture is about flutter, one of the popular mobile app development frameworks.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What is flutter?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter is a UI toolkit for creating fast, beautiful, natively compiled mobile applications with one programming language and a single codebase and it is developed by Google.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">The Flutter SDK has the packages and command-line tools that you need to develop Flutter apps across platforms.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter is based on the dart programming language.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter is free and open-source.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What are stateful widgets in flutter?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Great</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">There are several build-in widgets such as Appbar, Columb, container, Elevated button, icon, image, and so many other widgets.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Dart language has several features such as highly optimized for UI, productivity improvements with make changes interactively, Smooth animation and transitions, Just in time compile, and exceptionally fast development cycles.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">We can use any IDE for flutter development such as android studio, Xcode, Intelli J, visual studio, and so on.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter also supports hot reload.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Anyone has an idea?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Hot restart is much different than hot reload and in Hot restart it destroys the preserves State value and sets them to their default. So if you are using States value in your application then after every hot restart the developer gets a fully compiled application and all the states will be set to their defaults.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Flutter has several build modes such as debug, profile, and release.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">What are the gesture events in flutter?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">That's all for today's lecture.</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">Do you have any questions?</Post>
		<Post class="Lecturer">I will give the assignment in next week.</Post>
